  <blockquote>
  	On the shore of Lake Michigan, <b>Chicago</b> was incorporated as a city in 1837 <br>
	near a portage between the Great Lakes and the <u>Mississippi River</u> watershed.<br> 
	It grew rapidly in the mid-19th century; by 1860, Chicago was the youngest <br>
	U.S. city to exceed a population of 100,000. Even after 1871, when the Great <br>
	Chicago Fire destroyed several square miles and left more than 100,000 homeless<br> 
	Chicago's population grew to 503,000 by 1880 and then doubled to more than a <br>
	million within the decade. The construction boom accelerated population <br>
	growth throughout the following decades, and by 1900, less than 30 years <br>
	after the fire, Chicago was the fifth-largest city in the world. Chicago <br>
	made noted contributions to urban planning and zoning standards, including <br>
	new construction styles (such as, Chicago School architecture, the <br>
	development of the City Beautiful Movement, and the steel-framed skyscraper).
